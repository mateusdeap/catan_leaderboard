# README

This is a very simple application and has no aspirations to be much more
than what the title says.

I like to play Catan. So does my family. So do my friends. So I thought
we should keep track of who's best :)

## Install

Simple basic Rails installation process:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `bin/setup`

## Run

To start the app simply run:
```
bin/dev`
```

This application uses Tailwind and the tailwindcss-rails gem. In order to have the
watch feature, I decided to use the `bin/dev` script.

Since I use WSL, the tailwind build task is configured with the `poll` option.
