# README

This is a very simple application and has no aspirations to be much more
than what the title says.

I like to play Catan. So does my family. So do my friends. So I thought
we should keep track of who's best :)

## Install

Simple basic Rails installation process:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `bundle install`
